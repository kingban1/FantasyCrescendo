# How to Report a Bug with a Project
Fantasy Crescendo uses **GitHub Issues** to manage per-project issues. The process for submitting a bug to a Hourai Teahouse project is as follows:

1. If you do not already have a GitHub account, [create an account](https://github.com/join).
2. Login with your account.
3. Navigate to the issues page for the project you wish to report a bug for. 
4. Click the **New Issue** button.
5. Fill out the form with information about your bug. If the body is pre-filled for you, please provide the information requested by the template.
6. Click the **Submit** button.

# Guide to effectively reporting bugs
Creating proper bug reports is incredibly important for a tester. Developers cannot fix what they cannot replicate, so please provide as much information as possible.

* Include which version of the game you are playing on. what operating system, and, if the issue requires, information about the hardware on your machine.
* As accurately as possible, describe exactly what the bug entails.
* Provide as much information as to what the expect and actual behavior. 
* Provide information on exactly how to replicate the bug.
* Additional information that can be helpful:
  * Game Logs - this gives detailed information about what happened to your game, and if and when errors may have happened. To find these logs, see [these docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LogFiles.html).
  * Screenshots - if the issue is visual, please show what you see that seems to appear incorrectly.
  * For animations, [ScreenToGif](http://www.screentogif.com/|ScreenToGif) is a good option to short animations. If the bug is longer lasting, we suggest uploading a short video to demonstrate the issue.

> When you have reported a bug, you are expected to attend to the bug when possible. Developers may ask you to affirm if the bug has been resolved.
