<!-- TITLE: Steam -->

**Fantasy Crescendo** is now available for testing on Steam through a closed beta system.

# Requesting a Steam Key
To participate in this closed beta, you must request a Steam key from the project administrators. At the time of writing, this is best done through our Discord. You will be assigned a Steam key, that can be redeemed like any other Steam CD key.  Please refer to the [official Valve documentation](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5414-tfbn-1352) if you are having difficult activating the key.

> Hourai Teahouse reserves the right to revoke any provided Steam keys for any arbitrary reason. If found abusing the key(s), their use may be revoked without advanced notice.

# Release Branches
In the closed beta we have two open branches that we regularly release content to: **default** and **latest-beta**. The default branch is updated at a regular pace of once per week on Saturday. The latest-beta branch is updated as soon as game builds are ready. Installing the game by default subscribes you to the default branch. To opt-in to the bleeding edge latest-beta branch, please refer to [this guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=182912431) on how to change the branch your client is subscribed to.
