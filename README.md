*Fantasy Crescendo* is a collaborative community project to create a *[Touhou Project](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Project)* fangame akin to that of Super Smash Bros.

This project does not only consist of code contributions, and many of the assets included are custom art, music, sound effects, and 3D designs created by community submissions. For a full list of credits, see the [credits](./CREDITS.md) file in the repository.

## Installing
The recommended way of installing the game is through the dedicated game 
launcher. The launcher will automatically download and update the game 
with the latest builds from the project's Unity Cloud Build piepline:

 * [Windows](https://patch.houraiteahouse.net/fantasy-crescendo/launcher/Windows/FC_Setup.exe)
 * [macOS](https://patch.houraiteahouse.net/fantasy-crescendo/launcher/OSX/launcher)
 * [Ubuntu/Debian](https://patch.houraiteahouse.net/fantasy-crescendo/launcher/Linux/launcher).

A few important notes:

 * The Windows download is a installer that will automatically install the game for
   users.
 * At the current moment, the macOS and Linux installers do not come with platform specific 
   installers and are raw binaries that need to be executed from the command line. (Open to 
   any PRs that package the launcher into *.apps and *.debs).
 * The Linux builds has been tested only on Ubuntu/Debian, but should be executable
   in any Linux distro. **There is no official support for other Linux distros.**
 * The launcher is developed seperately and also open source. The repo is for it is hosted at
   https://github.com/HouraiTeahouse/HouraiLauncher.

## System Requirements

While still in development, we do not have a fixed set of minimum hardware 
requirements for the game. However, it is recommended that you are running
at least the following:

 * CPU: AMD FX-4350, 4.2 GHz / Intel Core i5-3470, 3.20 GHz or newer.
 * Memory: 8GB RAM or more.
 * GPU: Radeon HD 7870, 2 GB / GeForce GTX 660, 2 GB or newer.
 * Graphics: DirectX 11 or newer.
 * Networking: 256kbps Internet connection or faster. 

In testing the game while still in development, please understand that the 
adequate hardware to run the game may change at any point, and performance
regressions are to expected.
